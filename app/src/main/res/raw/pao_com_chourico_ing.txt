Preparação: 
1. Dissolve the yeast in the warm water, add a little flour and mix. Reserve. Mix the remaining flour with the salt and the baking powder and water. Knead very well, adding as much warm water as necessary to obtain a sufficiently consistent dough that does not cling to your hands. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rise for half an hour, until it doubles in volume. 
2. Cut the chorizo into slices. After baking, roll out the dough on a floured surface and place a row of chorizo slices on top. Roll the dough a little, place another row of slices of chorizo and repeat the operation, until you get a roll.
3. Sprinkle a tray with flour and place the bread on it. Make a few cuts on the surface of the dough and let it rise for another 20 minutes. Turn the oven to 200 ° C. Finally, take the bread in the middle of the oven and bake it for 30 minutes.
